          Islam, major world religion promulgated by the Prophet Muhammad
          &#65018; in Arabia in the 7th century CE. The Arabic term islām,
          literally “surrender,” illuminates the fundamental religious idea of
          Islam—that the believer (called a Muslim, from the active particle of
          islām) accepts surrender to the will of Allah (in Arabic, Allāh is the
          only true God. Allah is viewed as the sole God—creator, sustainer, and
          restorer of the world. The will of Allah, to which human beings must
          submit, is made known through the sacred scriptures, the Qurʾān (often
          spelled Koran in English), which Allah revealed to his messenger,
          Muhammad &#65018;. In Islam Muhammad &#65018; is considered the last
          and final of a series of prophets (including Adam, Noah, Abraham,
          Moses, Solomon, and Jesus), and his message simultaneously consummates
          and completes the “revelations” attributed to earlier prophets.

        <h2 class="pilar-h2">Iman (إِيمَان)</h2>
        <p>
          Iman (إِيمَان ʾīmān, lit. faith or belief) in Islamic theology denotes
          a believer's faith in the metaphysical aspects of Islam. Its most
          simple definition is the belief in the six articles of faith, known as
          arkān al-īmān. The term iman has been delineated in both the Quran and
          hadith. According to the Quran, iman must be accompanied by righteous
          deeds and the two together are necessary for entry into Paradise. In
          the hadith, iman in addition to Islam and ihsan form the three
          dimensions of the Islamic religion.

        <h2 class="pilar-h2">Solat (صلاۃ)</h2>
        <p>
          Salah, also called namaz, is the second pillar of Islam and a
          dailyobligation upon all Muslims above baligh (mature) age. Salah
          plays afundamental role in the Islamic faith and in this guide, we
          willexplore the most important facets of the second pillar of Islam.
          To begin with, there are fiveseparate daily prayers which must be
          performed; they are as follows:<br />
          Fajr – this is performed before sunrise <br />
          Zohr – this is performed at midday <br />
          Asr – this is performed between Zohr and sunset <br />
          Maghrib – this is performed at sunset <br />
          Isha – this is performed between Maghrib and midnight

        </div>
        <h2 class="pilar-h2">Siyam (صيام)</h2>
        <p>
          The Arabic word for fasting is called “siyam” in the Quran. The word
          siyam literally means “to abstain”. Chapter Maryam of the Quran says
          that Mary the mother of Jesus said “I have vowed a “siyam” (fast) for
          the sake of the Merciful, so today I shall not speak to anyone.”
          [Quran 19:26]. According to Shariyah, the word siyam means to abstain
          from all those things that are forbidden during fasting from the break
          of dawn to the sunset and to do this with the intention of fasting.
          <br />
          “Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before
          you, that you may attain taqwa.” [2:183]

        <p>
          hajj, also spelled ḥadjdj or hadj, in Islam, the pilgrimage to the
          holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia, which every adult Muslim must make
          at least once in his or her lifetime. The hajj is the fifth of the
          fundamental Muslim practices and institutions known as the Five
          Pillars of Islam. The pilgrimage rite begins on the 7th day of Dhū
          al-Ḥijjah (the last month of the Islamic year) and ends on the 12th
          day.

        <h2 class="pilar-h2">Zakat (زكاة)</h2>
        <p>
          As one of the pillars of Islam, zakat is a form of obligatory charity
          that has the potential to ease the suffering of millions. With the
          literal meaning of the word being ‘to cleanse,’ Muslims believe that
          paying zakat purifies, increases and blesses the remainder of their
          wealth.

          <br />
          The Sacred Mosque in Mecca Mecca is considered the holiest city in
          Islam, as it is home to Islam's holiest site Kaaba ('Cube') in the
          Masjid Al-Ḥaram (The Sacred Mosque). The area of Mecca, which includes
          Mount Arafah, Mina and Muzdalifah, is important for the Ḥajj
          ('Pilgrimage'). As one of the Five Pillars of Islam, every adult
          Muslim who is capable must perform the Hajj at least once in their
          lifetime.<br />
          <b style="color: rgb(1, 16, 104)">Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, Medina:</b>
          <br />
          Al-Masjid an-Nabawi is located in Medina, making the city the
          second-holiest site in Islam, after Mecca. Medina is the final
          place-of-residence of Muhammad, and where his qabr (grave) is located.
          In addition to the Prophet's Mosque, the city has the mosques of Qubā’
          and al-Qiblatayn ("The Two Qiblahs").<br />
          <b style="color: rgb(197, 92, 31)">Masjid Al-Aqsa, Jerusalem:</b>
          <br />
          Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem is the third holiest site in Islam. The
          covered mosque building was originally a small prayer house erected by
          Umar ibn al-Khattab, the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate. The
          mosque is held in esteem by the entire Muslim community, due to its
          history as a place of worship by many Islamic prophets such as
          Ibrahim,[2] Dawud, Sulaimaan, Ilyas and Isa.
